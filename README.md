# Media-List
A site for tracking what movies you've seen and plan on watching.
Can be found (here.)[http://18.117.173.166]

## Features

### RANDOMIZER
The RANDOMIZER button will grab a random movie from the user's list that wasn't marked as "watched" already. This was for people like me who have large lists of
suggested movies to watch and can't seem to choose what to watch next.

### Search
The search bar will retrieve information from IMDB API about the movie you have interest in to help you choose your next movie to watch.

### MediaList
The media list displays your selected movies and sorts your watched movies below the unwatched ones. You can click them to expand in order to read a description of the
movie, set it as watched or erase it from the list entirely.

## Objective
I made this project to familiarise myself with some modern technologies being used in web development right now such as React, Node.js, and MongoDB.
